# Homework

These homework files are also available on the git server. If you want to clone the homework repo with `git`, follow the steps:

1. Open your terminal and locate to the directory where you want to clone the homework files, eg., if I want to put everything in `~/VG100`, type `cd ~/VG100`.

2. Use the `git clone` command to clone the homework repository:
```bash
$ git clone ssh://git@focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn:2100/homework
```

3. The files will be in `~/VG100/homework`.

If you want to retrieve new homework, use the `git pull` command in `~/VG100/homework`. Sometimes you may meet merge conflicts, you can deal with them with any modern git GUI (eg., IDEs, sourcetree).

If you can clone the repo inside WSL, but can't clone it on Git Bash, you should follow the further reading part of [SSH Key](/vg100/markdown/env.ssh).
